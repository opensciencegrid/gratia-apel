# This file identifies the set of sets reportable to the APEL-LCG
# database and the normalization factor to be used in the
# gratia query.
#
# Format:
#  token 1 - The Site.SiteName
#  token 2 - The normalization value to be used. This was obtained
#            from site surveys regarding the hardware used on a
#            site's clusters and is an estimated value based
#            on a SPECint2000 specification.  If no value is 
#            specified, then a value is derived from the
#            gratia database using the gratia_psacct.ProbeName
#            specified in lcg.conf file.
#  This tokens are whitespace seperated.  
#  Comments - line starting with a # sign
#  Empty lines are permittted.

#   8/07/07 (John Weigand) 
#             Removed UCSanDiegoPG.
#             Added HEPGRID_UERJ,UCSDT2,UCSDT2-B.
#             These are the same WN clusters as the UCSanDiegoPG
#             for which there was no nomralization factor. So they
#             will take the default one.
#             This change was made at the request of Burt Holzman
#             and satifies the GOC ticket #1714.
#   6/19/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             The BNL_ATLAS_1 and BNL_ATLAS_2 sites were changed
#             to be BNL_OSG.  This was done by changing the
#             relation between the Site and Probe table on siteid.
#             The old site names are still reflected in the reporting
#             and all 3 assigned the same normalization factor as
#             they all feed the same WN cluster. 
#   9/12/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Added SLAC_PROD.
#   9/20/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Replaced SLAC_PROD with PROD_SLAC. 
#             There has been confusion over which it is and may have been
#             done incorrectly on 9/12/2007.
#   9/27/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for AGLT2 (2100)
#             Updated Normalization factor for PROD_SLAC (1757)
#   10/02/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for BNL_ATLAS_Tier2  (1294)
#             Updated Normalization factor for BNL_ATLAS_Tier2o (1645)
#             Also adjusted  BNL_ATLAS_1, BNL_ATLAS_2, BNL_OSG  (1351)
#              - appeared to be an error in the calulation
#             Updated Normalization factor for UTA_SWT2         (1543)
#             Updated Normalization factor for OU_OSCER_ATLAS   (1543)
#             Updated Normalization factor for OU_OCHEP_SWT2    (1543)
#             Updated Normalization factor for SLACXRD          (1757)
#             Updated Normalization factor for UC_Teraport      (1412)
#             Updated Normalization factor for MWT2_IU          (1787)
#             Updated Normalization factor for MWT2_UC          (1787)
#             Updated Normalization factor for UC_ATLAS_MWT2    (1169)
#             Updated Normalization factor for IU_ATLAS_TIER2    (921)
#             Added new atlas site IU_OSG with Normalization factor (2099)
#             Corrected Normalization factor for BNL_ATLAS_Tier2  (1123)
#             Corrected Normalization factor for BNL_ATLAS_Tier2o (1624)
#             Corrected Normalization factor for IU_OSG (1678)
#   10/03/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Removed SLACXRD. Name known only to Panda.
#             Updated Normalization factor for BNL_PANDA        (1351)
#   10/12/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for UTA_DPCC         (915)
#   11/08/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Replaced BNL_PANDA,BNL_OSG,BNL_LOCAL with US-T1-BNL
#   11/09/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for PROD_SLAC       (1726)
#   12/20/07 (John Weigand) - 
#             Replaced US-T1-BNL with BNL_ATLAS_1.  This undoes the 11/8/07
#             change.  The intent is to allow BNL_ATLAS_1 to appear in the
#             EGEE OSG view.  Then, in an EGEE Tier1 view translation table,
#             BNL_ATLAS_1 will translate to US-T1-BNL. In the short term,
#             both entries will be reflected until changes are made in
#             the EGEE site association table for the Tier 1 view.
#             When the changes to the Gratia Site table and EGEE tables
#             are complete the US-T1-BNL can be removed.
#   1/17/08 (John Weigand) -
#             US-T1-BNL to BNL_ATLAS_1 changes effected. 
#             Removing US-T1-BNL entry.
#   1/20/08 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for PROD_SLAC       (1779)
#   2/14/08 (John Weigand) - 
#             Updated Normalization factor for AGLT2 from 2100 to 2168
#             effective 1/1/2008.  Update for January effected 2/15.
#   3/18/08 (John Weigand) - 
#             Added SWT2_CPB (1645) per Pat McGuigan request
#   3/19/08 (John Weigand) 
#             Removed UCSDT2-B, BU_ATLAS_Tier2o, IU_ATLAS_Tier2, UTA_DPCC
#             in order for mail showing sites with no data is accurate.
#             These were deprecated some time ago.
#   3/21/08 (John Weigand)
#             Changed BU_ATLAS_Tier2 normalization (1533) per Saul Youssef
#             Combined BU_ATLAS_Tier2 and BU_ATLAS_Tier1o clusters
#   4/14/08 (John Weigand)
#             Adding UFlorida-HPC & UFlorida-IHEPA per Backjoo Kim 
#             Also changed the following factors using Brian Bocklemans system
#             that derives the processor model from GIP.

#   Changed NF for WT2 from 2412 to 3424
#
# 11/05/2010 (John Weigand)
#   - Added HU_ATLAS_Tier2 based on MyOsg InteropAccounting setting
#     and the fact that it is defined in the LCG Topology as a 
#     site for US_NET2.  Using BU_ATLAS_Tier2 NF until a real number
#     is available.
#   - Added Purdue-Rossmann based on MyOsg InteropAccouting setting 
#     and confirmation from the site admin on goc ticket 9500.
#     They will not show in EGEE Tier2 until they register with LCG.
#     Using Purdue-Steele NF until one is available.
# 
# 11/09/2010 (John Weigand)
# Update NF values based on 10/26/10 GIP.  After 10/26, a bug in
# Gratia (or somewhere else) is causing only deltas to show in the
# Nebraska Subcluster table these are derived from.

# Current SI2K values contained here for USATLAS is taken from the GIP and it is deemed inaccurate,
# since when converting these to HS06 values by multiplying by 4, they don't match with the 
# HS06 values directly calculated for the site. To fix this discrepancy, 
# I Updated the SI2K values for all USATLAS sites based on the values 
# contained in the spreadsheet maintained by Rob Gardner at 
# http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/CapacitySummary.html
# The direct link to this particular spreadsheet is
# http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/rsrc/Admins/CapacitySummary/Normalization-factors-USATLAS-v19-v1.xls
# This spreadsheet maintains the average HEPSPEC values for all the USATLAS sites
# The SI2K equivalent is obtained by dividing this HEPSPEC value by 4,
# and this is the value to which the USATLAS sites have been updated below
# For example the average HEPSPEC value for AGLT2 in Rob Gardner's spreadsheet above 
# is 8.50. So the equivalent SI2K value is 
# SI2K = HEPSPEC * 1000/4	= 8.50 * 1000/4 = 2125
# Here are the updates i.e. old values vs new values for all the USATLAS sites

# WT2      2650      2823
#     based on this rationale from Wei Yang..
#     Since WT2 is using HS06factor = 10.6 now and we see 6.1%

#        10.6/(1-6.1%) = 11.29
